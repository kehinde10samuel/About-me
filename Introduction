        <h1><center>ANUOLUWA SAMUEL KEHINDE</center></h1>
            <p><center><h2>Introduction</h2></center><br>
                My name is Anuoluwa Samuel Kehinde. I am a graduate of the University of Ilorin. I hold a BSc(Ed) in Biology Education, from the department of Science Education, University of Ilorin.
            I served (National Youth Service Corp) at Community Secondary School, Obangede, Kogi State, as a school teacher.</p>
            <p>
                After my graduation, I worked at Omolola High School, Ilorin, with a flawless record, between October 2019 and July 2021, rising through the ranks from a Junior staff (teacher) to a class teacher and finally to the position of Vice Principal.
                In my endeavor to raise the standard of education in the country, I join Teach For Nigeria (TFN). Teach for Nigeria is a Non-governmental organization that seeks to end the inequality in the education sector of the our dear nation "Nigeria".
                With the vision that "one day, every Nigerian child will have access to quality education", I went to an under-serve school in Lagos. My hope is that, I will be able to change the life of "one child" in the community.

                <center><h2>Things that I like</h2></center><br>
                I love teaching, especially when the students are willing to learn. I have once taught a class for a month for free. I also love yo read.
                I am not really a picky eater. <ul>Any of the following food will do:
                <li>Noodles with fried egg.</li>
                <li>Fried rice and chicken.</li>
                <li>Pounded yam with Egusi</li>
                <li>Spagetti and fried chicken</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><center><h2>Things I don`t like</h2></center>
                I hate lies, theft, gambling and anything thug-like, because I like to think that, I am a responsible man. I also hate to have to prove myself to anyone.
                <ul> The food I don`t really like include:
                    <li>Amala</li>
                    <li>Boiled yam</li>
                Not that I hate them like that, but, if given option, I will do away with them.
                </ul>
